Concurrent execution demonstration for routilux.

This demo shows:
1. Complex workflow with multiple routines
2. Concurrent execution of 4 jobs simultaneously
3. Thread pool management with max_workers < 4
4. Detailed monitoring and logging of all job states
5. Data and timestamp tracking across all routines
