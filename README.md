# FlowForge

Event-driven workflow orchestration framework with flexible connection, state management, and workflow orchestration capabilities.

## Features

* **Slots and Events Mechanism**: Clear distinction between input slots and output events
* **Many-to-Many Connections**: Flexible connection relationships between routines
* **State Management**: Unified `stats()` method for tracking routine state
* **Flow Manager**: Workflow orchestration, persistence, and recovery
* **JobState Management**: Execution state recording and recovery functionality
* **Error Handling**: Multiple error handling strategies (STOP, CONTINUE, RETRY, SKIP)
* **Execution Tracking**: Comprehensive execution tracking and performance monitoring
* **Serialization Support**: Full serialization/deserialization support for persistence

## Installation

### For Development (Recommended)

```bash
# Install package in editable mode with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Or using Makefile
make dev-install
```

This installs the package in "editable" mode, meaning:
- Changes to source code are immediately available
- No need to reinstall after code changes
- All imports work correctly without `sys.path` manipulation

### For Production

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Or install from a built package:

```bash
pip install dist/flowforge-*.whl
```

## Quick Start

### Creating a Routine

```python
from flowforge import Routine

class DataProcessor(Routine):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.input_slot = self.define_slot("input", handler=self.process_data)
        self.output_event = self.define_event("output", ["result"])
    
    def process_data(self, data: str):
        result = f"Processed: {data}"
        self._stats["processed_count"] = self._stats.get("processed_count", 0) + 1
        self.emit("output", result=result)
```

### Creating and Connecting a Flow

```python
from flowforge import Flow

flow = Flow(flow_id="my_flow")

processor1 = DataProcessor()
processor2 = DataProcessor()

id1 = flow.add_routine(processor1, "processor1")
id2 = flow.add_routine(processor2, "processor2")

flow.connect(id1, "output", id2, "input")
```

### Executing a Flow

```python
job_state = flow.execute(id1, entry_params={"data": "test"})
print(job_state.status)  # "completed"
print(processor1.stats())  # {"processed_count": 1}
```
