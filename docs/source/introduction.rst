Introduction
============

Routilux is a powerful, event-driven workflow orchestration framework designed for building
flexible and maintainable data processing pipelines. With its intuitive slot-and-event mechanism,
Routilux makes it easy to connect routines, manage state, and orchestrate complex workflows
while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

Why Routilux?
--------------

Building workflow-based applications can be challenging. You need to:

* **Connect components** in flexible ways (one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many)
* **Manage state** across multiple processing steps
* **Handle errors** gracefully with retry, skip, or continue strategies
* **Track execution** for debugging and monitoring
* **Scale** with concurrent execution for I/O-bound operations
* **Persist** workflows for recovery and resumption

Routilux addresses all these needs with a clean, Pythonic API that feels natural to use.

What Makes Routilux Special?
------------------------------

**🎯 Event-Driven Architecture**

Routilux uses a clear slot-and-event mechanism where routines communicate through well-defined
interfaces. This makes your workflows easy to understand, test, and maintain.

.. code-block:: python

   class DataProcessor(Routine):
       def __init__(self):
           super().__init__()
           # Define input slot
           self.input_slot = self.define_slot("input", handler=self.process)
           # Define output event
           self.output_event = self.define_event("output", ["result"])
       
       def process(self, data):
           result = f"Processed: {data}"
           self.emit("output", result=result)

**🔗 Flexible Connections**

Connect routines in any pattern you need - one-to-many, many-to-one, or complex branching patterns.
Routilux handles the complexity while you focus on your business logic.

.. code-block:: python

   # One event to multiple slots
   flow.connect(source_id, "output", processor1_id, "input")
   flow.connect(source_id, "output", processor2_id, "input")
   
   # Multiple events to one slot (with merge strategy)
   flow.connect(source1_id, "output", aggregator_id, "input")
   flow.connect(source2_id, "output", aggregator_id, "input")

**📊 Built-in Routines**

Routilux comes with a rich set of built-in routines ready to use:

* **Text Processing**: ``TextClipper``, ``TextRenderer``, ``ResultExtractor``
* **Data Processing**: ``DataTransformer``, ``DataValidator``, ``DataFlattener``
* **Control Flow**: ``ConditionalRouter`` for dynamic routing
* **Utilities**: ``TimeProvider`` for time-based operations

.. code-block:: python

   from routilux.builtin_routines import TextClipper, ConditionalRouter
   
   clipper = TextClipper()
   clipper.set_config(max_length=1000)
   
   router = ConditionalRouter()
   router.set_config(routes=[
       ("high_priority", "data.get('priority') == 'high'"),
       ("normal", "data.get('priority') == 'normal'"),
   ])

**⚡ Event Queue Architecture**

Routilux uses an event queue pattern for workflow execution:
- Non-blocking ``emit()``: Returns immediately after enqueuing tasks
- Unified execution model: Sequential and concurrent modes use the same queue mechanism
- Fair scheduling: Tasks are processed fairly, preventing long chains from blocking shorter ones
- Automatic flow detection: ``emit()`` automatically detects flow from routine context

.. code-block:: python

   flow = Flow(execution_strategy="concurrent", max_workers=5)
   # Tasks execute in parallel via event queue

**🛡️ Robust Error Handling**

Multiple error handling strategies (STOP, CONTINUE, RETRY, SKIP) let you build resilient
workflows that handle failures gracefully.

.. code-block:: python

   from routilux import ErrorHandler, ErrorStrategy
   
   error_handler = ErrorHandler(
       strategy=ErrorStrategy.RETRY,
       max_retries=3
   )
   flow.set_error_handler(error_handler)

**💾 Full Serialization Support**

Serialize and deserialize entire flows for persistence, recovery, and distributed execution.

.. code-block:: python

   # Serialize
   flow_data = flow.serialize()
   
   # Deserialize
   new_flow = Flow.deserialize(flow_data)

Built-in execution tracking provides insights into workflow performance, execution history,
and routine statistics.

Architecture and Responsibility Separation
------------------------------------------

Understanding the clear separation of responsibilities between ``Flow``, ``Routine``, and ``JobState``
is **crucial** for effectively using Routilux. This separation enables flexible, scalable, and maintainable
workflow applications.

**Core Components and Their Responsibilities**:

**Routine** - Function Implementation
   Routines define **what** each node does. They are pure function implementations:
   
   * **Slots** (0-N): Input mechanisms that receive data
   * **Events** (0-N): Output mechanisms that emit data
   * **Configuration** (``_config``): Static configuration parameters (set via ``set_config()``)
   * **No Runtime State**: Routines **must not** modify instance variables during execution
   * **Execution Context Access**: Use ``get_execution_context()`` to access flow, job_state, and routine_id
   
   **Key Constraint**: The same routine object can be used by multiple concurrent executions.
   Modifying instance variables would cause data corruption. All execution-specific state
   must be stored in ``JobState``.

**Flow** - Workflow Structure and Configuration
   Flows define **how** routines are connected and configured:
   
   * **Workflow Structure**: Defines which routines exist and how they're connected
   * **Static Configuration**: Node-level static parameters (execution strategy, max_workers, etc.)
   * **Connection Management**: Links events to slots with parameter mapping
   * **Execution Orchestration**: Manages event queue, task scheduling, and thread pool
   * **No Runtime State**: Flow does **not** store execution state or business data
   
   **Key Point**: Flow is a **template** that can be executed multiple times, each with its own ``JobState``.

**JobState** - Runtime State and Business Data
   JobState stores **everything** related to a specific execution:
   
   * **Execution State**: Status (pending, running, paused, completed, failed, cancelled)
   * **Routine States**: Per-routine execution state dictionaries
   * **Execution History**: Complete record of all routine executions with timestamps
   * **Business Data**: ``shared_data`` (read/write) and ``shared_log`` (append-only) for intermediate data
   * **Output Handling**: ``output_handler`` and ``output_log`` for execution-specific output
   * **Deferred Events**: Events to be emitted on resume
   * **Pause Points**: Checkpoints for resumption
   
   **Key Point**: Each ``flow.execute()`` call creates a **new, independent** ``JobState``.
   Multiple executions = multiple independent ``JobState`` objects.

**Connection**
   Links events to slots with optional parameter mapping. Supports flexible
   connection patterns.

**ErrorHandler**
   Configurable error handling with multiple strategies.

**ExecutionTracker**
   Monitors execution performance and event flow.

**Why This Separation Matters**:

1. **Multiple Executions**: The same flow can run multiple times concurrently, each with its own state
2. **Serialization**: Flow (structure) and JobState (state) are serialized separately, enabling:
   - Workflow templates that can be shared
   - Execution state that can be persisted and resumed
   - Distributed execution across hosts
3. **State Isolation**: Each execution's state is completely isolated, preventing data corruption
4. **Reusability**: Routine objects can be reused across multiple executions without conflicts
5. **Clarity**: Clear boundaries make code easier to understand, test, and maintain

**Example - Correct Usage**:

.. code-block:: python

   from routilux import Flow, Routine
   
   class Processor(Routine):
       def __init__(self):
           super().__init__()
           # Static configuration (set once)
           self.set_config(threshold=10, timeout=30)
           self.input_slot = self.define_slot("input", handler=self.process)
           self.output_event = self.define_event("output", ["result"])
       
       def process(self, data=None, **kwargs):
           # Read static config
           threshold = self.get_config("threshold", 0)
           
           # Get execution context for runtime state
           ctx = self.get_execution_context()
           if ctx:
               # Store execution-specific state in JobState
               ctx.job_state.update_routine_state(ctx.routine_id, {"processed": True})
               
               # Store business data in JobState
               ctx.job_state.update_shared_data("last_processed", data)
               ctx.job_state.append_to_shared_log({"action": "process", "data": data})
               
               # Send output via JobState
               self.send_output("user_data", message="Processing", value=data)
           
           # Emit event (for workflow flow)
           self.emit("output", result=f"Processed: {data}")
   
   # Flow defines structure (static)
   flow = Flow(flow_id="my_workflow")
   processor = Processor()
   processor_id = flow.add_routine(processor, "processor")
   
   # Each execution has its own JobState (runtime)
   job_state1 = flow.execute(processor_id, entry_params={"data": "A"})
   job_state2 = flow.execute(processor_id, entry_params={"data": "B"})
   
   # Each JobState is independent
   assert job_state1.job_id != job_state2.job_id
   assert job_state1.shared_data != job_state2.shared_data
