Tutorial
========

This tutorial will guide you through using Routilux step by step, from creating
your first routine to building complex workflows with error handling, concurrent
execution, and advanced patterns.

The tutorial is designed to be hands-on. Each chapter includes working code
examples that you can run and experiment with. We recommend following the
chapters in order, as each builds upon concepts introduced in previous chapters.

Learning Path
-------------

The tutorial is organized into progressive chapters:

1. **Getting Started** - Create your first routine and flow
2. **Connecting Routines** - Learn how to connect routines and understand event flow
3. **Data Flow and Parameters** - Understand how data flows between routines
4. **State Management** - Track execution state and statistics
5. **Error Handling** - Build resilient workflows with error handling strategies
6. **Concurrent Execution** - Execute independent routines in parallel
7. **Advanced Patterns** - Learn aggregation patterns, conditional routing, and more
8. **Serialization and Persistence** - Save and restore workflow state

Each chapter includes:

- **Learning Objectives**: What you'll learn by the end of the chapter
- **Step-by-step examples**: Progressive code examples with explanations
- **Expected Output**: Verified output from running the examples
- **Key Points**: Important concepts and best practices
- **Common Pitfalls**: Mistakes to avoid and how to fix them
- **Best Practices**: Recommended approaches for production code
